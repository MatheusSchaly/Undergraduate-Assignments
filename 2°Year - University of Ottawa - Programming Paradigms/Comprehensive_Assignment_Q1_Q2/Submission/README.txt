1) If for some reason you can't execute the files in the this current folder, the full project is inside the "Helper" folder.
2) Depending on the enconding of the csv file, the Go program may give incorrect outputs. If that is the case, I ask you to 
   open the Go main code and: 
   Uncomment the lines from 191 to 196 and from 200 to 204 and comment the lines 197, 198 and 204. 
   Also change the "Thales" at line 199 to the first element of your employers csv file. 
   For example, in our 10x10 employers csv file the fist element is "Industry Canada", so change "Thales" to "Industry Canada"
