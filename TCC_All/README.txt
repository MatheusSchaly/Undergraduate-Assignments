OUTDATED:
There are two ways to execute the TCC code:
1. Use Jupyter Notebook to run file TCC_LSTM_Matheus_Schaly.ipynb. If you have Anaconda installed, you'll only have to install Tensorflow to run the code. To install Tensorflow simply uncomment the correspoding line in the script. You'll also need to download the data locally, to do so, simply follow the instructions on the script.
1. Use Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qetUmLsPahJ8q78mahj4q0qb2FWLXmgX?usp=sharing. If you run this code using hosted runtime, keep in mind that you'll have limited time and resources, which is most likely not be enough to run the entire script, especially considering the LSTM training process.
