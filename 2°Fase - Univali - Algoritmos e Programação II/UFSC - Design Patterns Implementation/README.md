# Design-Patterns-in-Python

Here you will find a brief <b> explanation </b> of the 23 design patterns, as well as their <b> Python code </b> and <b> UML </b> representation (I'm working on the UML, but I took it mainly from the first reference below, the Design Patterns book. Wikipedia has similar UMLs). I'm only a student, so don't rely too much on the this repository. I also appreciate any suggestions.

My main references were:
1. Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (very good)
2. Wikipedia.org
3. Sourcemaking.com
4. Youtube.com - Derek Banas
5. Tutorialspoint.com
6. Geeksforgeeks.org
7. Learning Python Design Patterns - Second Edition (not that good)
