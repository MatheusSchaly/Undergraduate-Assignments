# Bridge

â€¢	Creates two separate hierarchies (1, 4) by decoupling the abstraction (1, 2, 3) from its implementation (4, 5, 6). So that the two can vary dynamically independently.
1.	Abstraction: Shape
2.	Refined Abstraction 1: Rectangle
3.	Refined Abstraction 2: Circle
4.	Implementor: Color
5.	Concrete Implementation 1: Red_Color
6.	Concrete Implementation 2: Blue_Color
